                  <p>Buying insurance is hard. Reading a policy
                    document is even harder. And even if you make an
                    effort to painstakingly go through this thing,
                    you’ll most likely draw a blank because you won’t
                    know what half those words mean. So in a bid to
                    uncomplicate matters and teach you how to read a
                    policy document, we’ve created a set of simple
                    case studies to explain what some of the most
                    common terms and features actually mean. We will
                    also tell you how they impact you and why you may
                    or may not need them.</p>
                  <p>So let’s start with the most ubiquitous feature
                    within the health insurance universe— Co-payment.</p>

                    You’re about to buy health insurance. The agent
                    pitches a policy with a cover totaling 5 Lakhs for
                    a bargain price of just ₹7000 a year. But then he
                    sweetens the pot even further. He promises to cut
                    down the premium by 25% (roughly ₹1800/year) if
                    only you agree to a 20% co-payment clause. You
                    think that’s amazing and you sign off on the
                    agreement. Wow, you just saved ₹1800.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    9 months later, you suffer an accident. You’re
                    hospitalized and you need extensive care.
                    Thankfully you make a full recovery and the bill
                    adds up to ₹2 Lakh. No problem. You’ve got
                    insurance. However, the insurer only pays
                    ₹1,60,000. They ask you to pay the remaining
                    ₹40,000 out of pocket since you promised to co-pay
                    20% of the bill.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You start doing the math. You saved ₹1,800 but you
                    had to pay ₹40,000 because of the co-payment
                    clause. It would take ~22 years worth of premium
                    savings to make up for this fatal mistake. Not
                    something you want in your insurance policy
                  </p>

                    Imagine falling sick and finding out your insurer
                    has a limit on room rent. You pick up the policy
                    document begrudgingly and notice that that cap is
                    set at 1% of your sum insured. 1% of ₹5 lakh
                    insured is ₹5,000 each day. That’s not a lot. And
                    now you are upset you can’t pick the room you
                    wanted — one that costs ₹10,000 a day.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But you’re fairly certain you won’t be staying
                    here for long. It’s only going to be for a couple
                    of days. And even if you pick the nicer room,
                    you’ll only have to pay the extra ₹10,000 (2
                    days*5000). So you choose the plush room anyway.
                    However, 2 days later, you’re discharged and the
                    insurance company drops a bombshell.
                  </p>
                  <p>You’ll have to pay an extra ₹25,000. What?</p>
                  <p>
                    Well, their carefully worded policy document notes
                    that most services rendered in your room including
                    surgeon fee, consultant fee, other diagnostic
                    exams, etc will not be covered fully. Instead,
                    they'll only pay a part of it because you picked a
                    room that's too expensive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    How much will they pay? Well, here's the math. The
                    cap on room rent was fixed at ₹5,000, remember?
                    Your actual room rent stood at ₹10,000. So they'll
                    cover half your room rent and half the cost of all
                    the services rendered in your room. For instance,
                    if you have to undergo an operation and the
                    surgeon's fee adds up to ₹50,000. They'll only pay
                    ₹25,000. The rest is on you.
                  </p>

                  <div class="advice">
                    Avoid policies with caps on room rent. It’s that
                    simple. If you still want to pursue this policy,
                    make sure you pick a room that’s well within the
                    limit.

                    10 lakh cover at a premium of just ₹6,000 a year.
                    That’s the offer in front of you. But instead of
                    jumping for joy, you’re suspecting something
                    already. This guy is offering you a price that
                    nobody else is matching. You are sceptical and you
                    ponder for a while. But you go ahead with his
                    recommendation anyway since he is a family friend
                    of sorts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And then, one day, your worst fears come true. A
                    slipped disk forces you into the operation
                    theatre. You require extensive treatment. The
                    final bill is hefty. ₹4,36,000 — inclusive of all
                    costs. But despite your 10 lakh cover the insurer
                    tells you they can only cover ₹2,00,000. You are
                    outraged and you press for a clarification.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Eventually, they tell you your policy has disease
                    wise sub-limits. Meaning, they have a cap on the
                    total coverage amount specifically mandated for
                    certain diseases.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For instance, cardiovascular diseases — They only
                    pay ₹2,50,000
                  </p>
                  <p>For knee replacements —₹2,75,000</p>
                  <p>
                    For other major operations like the one you just
                    had — ₹2,00,000
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And finally, you realize how the company could
                    offer you a ₹10 Lakh cover at such a low premium.
                    They probably never end up paying the full cover
                    amount in most cases.

                    The scariest thing about insurance is the
                    uncertainty involved in buying a policy - because
                    the moment the sweet-talking concludes, the
                    insurer will want to talk to you about your
                    medical history. Do you have diabetes? Do you have
                    any cardiovascular problems? Do you have
                    thyroid-related illnesses? Or do you have any
                    other pre-existing conditions? The list is
                    endless.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <br />Once they are through with that line of
                    questioning, they might ask you to take a few
                    medical tests. And based off of these reports,
                    they will tell you that they will cover your
                    hospitalization expense so long as it's not
                    related to your pre-existing condition. But what
                    happens if you are hospitalized for a complication
                    arising out of a past condition? Well, in that
                    case, they will ask you to wait for a
                    while - maybe 2 to 4 years. And while it makes
                    sense for the insurer to add this clause, it can
                    be a particularly gruelling exercise for you.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <br />See the problem here is straightforward.
                    Let's say you have problems with your blood
                    pressure. You disclose this condition and then you
                    buy your policy. Unfortunately, the very next
                    year, you have a heart attack and you are
                    desperately hoping your insurer will come through.
                    However, it's quite possible that the insurer can
                    deny your claim if they can connect your blood
                    pressure disorder to the heart attack. So if an
                    insurer makes you wait 4 years, you just have to
                    hope and pray that you don't fall sick because of
                    a pre-existing disease. And trust us, it's not a
                    good place to be at.

                    You wake up one day and you start feeling dizzy.
                    You consult your doctor. She prescribes a blood
                    test. Nothing out of the ordinary, she says. So
                    you go home with an ORS pack. But your condition
                    deteriorates. You feel dizzy once again next
                    evening. And this time the doctor prescribes an
                    MRI. She checks the results and asks you to admit
                    yourself to the hospital.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The doctor effectively treats your condition over
                    the course of the next 3 days and you are
                    discharged soon after.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Hospital Bill adds up to ₹10,000</p>
                  <p>
                    The MRI and the diagnostic tests before
                    hospitalization adds up to ₹15,000
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You are hoping your insurance covers both bills.
                    But the company states they don’t cover
                    pre-hospitalization expenses. Meaning they won’t
                    cover all the costs you had to bear leading up to
                    your hospitalization. Which is ironical because
                    doctors often prescribe a host of diagnostic tests
                    before they admit you to a hospital and sometimes
                    even after they discharge you. And it can get
                    quite expensive.

                    It’s always a good idea to pick a policy that

                    It’s a Sunday morning and you’re sipping coffee on
                    the hospital bed. You are thinking about how a
                    small heart complication forced you into a 3-week
                    stay at the hospital. More importantly, you’re
                    thinking about how you racked up a bill totaling
                    ₹4,88,000. Thankfully, your insurance policy is
                    going to take care of the burden. After all, you
                    have a ₹5 Lakh cover. So you don’t have to pay
                    anything right now. But you start thinking about
                    other possibilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    See, you bought a combined policy — For both your
                    wife and yourself. And if she were to fall sick
                    anytime soon, then the insurance won’t cover her
                    bills. You’ve used up the benefits already.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But what if the insurance restored itself to the
                    initial state immediately after you make a claim?
                    What if your insurer offered you a ₹5 lakh cover
                    once again in the event you or your wife have to
                    be hospitalized anytime soon?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Well…Guess what? It’s possible with a restoration
                    benefit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While some policies offer unlimited restoration
                    for any illness, others have some restrictions.
                    For instance, some policies will tell you that you
                    can’t claim the restoration benefit if you have
                    the same illness once again. In this case — a
                    heart complication.
                  </p>
                  <!--kg-card-begin: html-->
                  <div class="advice">
                    It’s always prudent to opt for restoration
                    benefits if you have a combined policy. It also
                    makes sense even if it’s an individual policy.
                    Just make sure you read the fine print on how the
                    cover is restored each time and you’ll be set.

                    You are out playing a game of cards with your
                    friends. Suddenly you feel a sharp twitch in your
                    abdomen. It's odd, but these things keep happening
                    to you all the time. So you don't pay a lot of
                    attention. A few moments pass. and then suddenly
                    the twitch is there again. This time it doesn't go
                    away. Instead, within a moment the pain
                    intensifies. Soon, it becomes unbearable. Your
                    friends take you to the hospital. And after a
                    quick inspection, the doctor breaks the news. It's
                    appendicitis and they have to operate on you
                    immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <br />But it's not that big of a deal. In fact,
                    the doctor assures you that he'll discharge you
                    the same day. And although you require some
                    treatment, you walk out of the hospital within 24
                    hours. However, it's an expensive procedure. The
                    bill adds up to ₹80,000 and you're gobsmacked. You
                    call your insurer hoping they will cover these
                    costs in full. And suddenly they break the news to
                    you. <strong>They won't cover this</strong>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You are incensed and you press for a
                    clarification. The agent calms you down and walks
                    you through the policy document once again - where
                    they explicitly note how they don't cover daycare
                    treatments. Or in other words, treatments that
                    require hospitalization but those that last less
                    than 24 hours. Think - Chemotherapy, Dialysis or
                    in this case appendicitis.

                    go away on its own. But then you have trouble
                    breathing. Your condition deteriorates and you are
                    forced to call the emergency services. But they
                    tell you they can’t find a hospital bed. Your only
                    choice is to obtain treatment at home. Some
                    hospitals provide this facility. But it's going to

                    But you are glad you have this facility
                    nonetheless.

                    Insurers will tell you they want you to stay fit
                    and healthy. In fact, they will even incentivize
                    you in a bid to achieve this objective. For
                    instance, how would you feel if somebody told you
                    they’ll up your cover (above and beyond the sum
                    insured) by 50% each year in the event you don’t
                    claim insurance. That would be amazing, right?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Think about it. You could start with a cover of ₹5
                    lakhs. And then see it move up to ₹7.5 lakhs and
                    then the next year, another 50% over and the above
                    the sum insured would take your total cover to 10
                    lakhs. Obviously, they’ll stop at some point. Most
                    insurance companies will tell you they’ll stop
                    once the cover doubles in value. In fact, they’ll
                    also tell you they’ll cut the sum insured by the
                    same amount (50%) in the event you claim insurance
                    after receiving the bonus. So technically, next
                    year, you could be back with a cover of just 5
                    lakhs.
                  </p>
                  <p>But still, it’s a pretty nifty bonus.</p>
                  <!--kg-card-begin: html-->
                  <div class="advice">
                    No Claim Bonus is pretty useful. All you have to
                    do is make sure that the bonus is actually
                    substantial. For instance, anything below 10% is
                    not really meaningful. So it might just be a
                    marketing tactic.

                  <p>
                    It's a lazy Saturday afternoon. You've been
                    waiting for almost an hour now and you can't help
                    but look at the receptionist intently hoping he
                    will call your name. And then suddenly when you
                    least expect it, you hear your name called out
                    loud. You walk into the doctor's room. She directs
                    you to a certain spot and measures your height.
                    She then checks your weight. She makes you sit
                    straight and then takes your blood pressure. She
                    listens to your heart and lungs and orders a blood
                    test for cholesterol and blood sugar. And just
                    before you leave, she offers some advice on how
                    you can lower risks for diabetes, heart disease,
                    and cancer. You get your reports the next day and
                    everything is perfect. You don't need follow-up
                    care. At least, not until next year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <br />What you just had was a full body health
                    checkup. And while some people might just ignore
                    it altogether, it gives you a certain peace of
                    mind. Now usually these health checkups can cost
                    you anywhere between ₹1,000 and ₹1,500. And if
                    you're fairly regular with these checkups, it's
                    going to weigh on your pockets consistently.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once again, we know it's not a lot of money. But
                    it wouldn't hurt if you save on these costs
                    entirely. And that's why some insurers will pay
                    for your health checkups. Okay, maybe they won't
                    do it every year. But even if they do it once in 2
                    years it's still an added bonus, right?

                    You’re pushing 50 and you feel drained each day.
                    You go to your physician and he tells you there’s
                    nothing wrong. “It could be stress”, he exclaims.
                    You are unsatisfied but you go home nonetheless.
                    The next day however you bump into your neighbour.
                    You start chatting and he suggests visiting a
                    government certified Ayush Centre.

                    So you visit the facility and meet with the
                    practitioners. They suggest getting an Ayurvedic
                    Rejuvenation Therapy — Panchakarma. It’s going to
                    last 7–11 days and it’s going to cost you ₹25,000.
                    That’s quite expensive you think. And then
                    suddenly it hits, your health insurance policy
                    covers Ayush treatments. So you sign off on the
                    payment and get started immediately. Good thing,
                    you remembered that little detail eh?

                    You are thinking of having kids. But you know
                    you'll have to plan for it in advance. The first
                    order of business is to make arrangements for
                    childbirth - when you will have to visit the
                    hospital and get the baby delivered. You know
                    getting there won't be a problem, but the
                    hospitalization could turn out to be an expensive
                    affair. But what if you could offset this by
                    opting for an insurance policy that covers this
                    cost? It looks like a solid idea. But alas… This
                    plan has some issues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For starters, the insurer knows for certain that
                    they'll have to bear this expense in the event you
                    decide to have kids. And since most people have at
                    least one kid, the insurer will most likely have
                    to pay up. So, many companies simply don't offer

                    So they'll push the premiums way higher. Or
                    they'll tell you they'll only cover a small part
                    of the expense. Or sometimes, they'll only offer
                    it in a family plan and make sure both you and
                    your spouse are covered - in which case one of you
                    is opting for the benefit even if you won't be
                    hospitalized for a maternity-related matter.

                    Everybody visits the doctor at least once a year.
                    But the doctor you visit — Her consultation fee is
                    off the roof. A routine inspection could set you
                    back thousands. So you come up with a genius plan.
                    You decide to buy insurance and opt for a policy
                    that reimburses all expenses incurred during these
                    visits. You look for options that include
                    outpatient consultation benefits and you find one
                    after a couple of minutes of search.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You exclaim — “Genius.” And you give yourself a
                    pat on the back.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But alas... Nothing in this godforsaken world is
                    as it seems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For starters, the insurer knows for certain that
                    they’ll have to pay you something each year. Just
                    ask yourself. Have you been to the doctor this
                    year? Have you paid over ₹1,000 in consultation
                    fee? Have you paid more? Do you think this trend
                    is likely to change?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yeah... It’s not going to change. So it’s quite
                    likely that the insurer will be forced to
                    reimburse you some amount each year. And that’s
                    why many companies simply don’t offer this
                    benefit. The ones that do will make sure they are
                    adequately compensated. So they’ll push the
                    premiums way higher. Or they’ll tell you they’ll
                    only cover a small part of the expense.
